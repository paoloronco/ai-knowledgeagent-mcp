# Troubleshooting

## Docker container exits immediately or the Web UI is unreachable

Use the complete `docker run` commands in the root README, including port, volume, and restart flags. Check `docker ps -a`, `docker logs knowledge-mcp`, and `docker logs knowledge-mcp-host-agent`. With Compose, check `docker compose ps` and `docker compose logs app host-agent`. Open `http://HOST_IP:8080` from the LAN. If it works at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` on the Docker host but not from another computer, check that Docker published port 8080 on `0.0.0.0` and that the host firewall allows it.

## Docker prints localized progress messages

The Docker client prints its own container creation and pull messages using its host settings. These messages are outside the application. On Linux, run a command with `LC_ALL=C` if you want to request English output from the Docker client, for example `LC_ALL=C docker compose up -d`.

## ImportError: MCPServer

Install the declared dependencies in the active virtual environment: python -m pip install -r knowledge-mcp/requirements.txt. The server uses the MCP Python SDK 2.x import path mcp.server.mcpserver.

## Missing policy or knowledge root

Create knowledge-mcp/.env from .env.example and set KNOWLEDGE_ROOT to an existing directory. Ingestion reads knowledge-mcp/mcp/index-policy.yaml by default; POLICY_FILE can override it.

## Qdrant unavailable

Check curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:6333/readyz and QDRANT_URL. knowledge_status reports unavailable when it cannot count the collection. Ingestion must create and populate the collection before the first search.

## Search misses newly indexed files

Restart the MCP server after ingestion. Retrieval snapshots Qdrant payloads into memory on its first search.

## Empty PDF results

The parser extracts embedded text only. It does not OCR scanned pages.

## Indexing reaches 100% but reports failures

The percentage counts documents examined, including any that fail parsing or indexing. Documents completed before the error remain in Qdrant, and the next run skips unchanged documents recorded in the persistent ingestion state. The Indexing page shows per-document errors and downloads for the full output and timestamped status log. You can fix a source file or choose **Ignore this file** to add it to the policy before retrying. Older runs may have only the full log; to inspect their per-file errors in a Docker installation, run:

```bash
docker exec knowledge-mcp sh -lc 'find /data/ingestion -name errors.log -type f -print -exec tail -n 20 {} \;'
```

Review file paths before sharing this output because it may contain private names. Microsoft Office lock files beginning with `~$` are excluded by current releases. After updating both app and host-agent containers while retaining their named volumes, run the incremental update from the dashboard; already indexed documents are not embedded again.

## SentenceTransformer import fails in torchvision

Check that torch and torchvision in the active environment are compatible. A mismatched pair can fail before the embedding model loads. Ingestion dry runs and knowledge_status do not require the model.

## Remote client receives 403

Check the proxy or Cloudflare Access policy. The MCP server does not issue 403 on its own. Test the endpoint with an MCP client, not a plain GET request.

## Service logs

On a systemd deployment, use sudo journalctl -u knowledge-mcp -f. Ingestion parse errors are written under INGESTION_BASE_DIR/logs/errors.log.
