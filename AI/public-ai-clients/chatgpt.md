# ChatGPT

Expose the server through an authenticated HTTPS MCP endpoint. The [Cloudflare guide](../../knowledge-mcp/security/cloudflare/README.md) describes one way to do that. In ChatGPT, add the remote MCP URL using the current [OpenAI MCP app instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12584461-developer-mode-and-mcp-apps-in-chatgpt). Product menus and availability can change; follow the current product documentation.

Use the public portal URL if you created a Cloudflare MCP portal, or the protected origin URL if your client and authentication flow support it. Test the connection by calling knowledge_status. Search takes only one argument: query. The server does not accept per-call limit settings.

Retrieved excerpts are sent to ChatGPT. Review the [security model](../../docs/security-model.md) and index policy before connecting a private corpus.
