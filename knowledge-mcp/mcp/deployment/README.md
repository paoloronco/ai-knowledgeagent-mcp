# Linux deployment

This is a manual example for a Linux host with Python 3.10+, Docker and a document directory mounted read-only. Adjust user names and paths for your system. The application does not configure Cloudflare or authentication.

## Qdrant

Run Qdrant with both ports bound to loopback and persistent storage:

~~~bash
docker volume create qdrant_storage
docker run -d --name qdrant --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:6333:6333 -p 127.0.0.1:6334:6334 \
  -v qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage qdrant/qdrant:latest
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:6333/readyz
~~~

Pin and test a specific Qdrant image version for your deployment before production upgrades.

## Application

Clone [paoloronco/knowledge-mcp](https://github.com/paoloronco/knowledge-mcp) under /opt/knowledge-mcp and create a dedicated service account with read access to the document mount. From /opt/knowledge-mcp/knowledge-mcp:

~~~bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
~~~

Edit .env. Set KNOWLEDGE_ROOT to the mounted read-only document path, INGESTION_BASE_DIR to a writable state directory, and MCP_HOST to 127.0.0.1 if the tunnel or reverse proxy runs on the same host. Restrict .env permissions to the service account. Run a dry run, then a full ingestion:

~~~bash
python ingestion/ingest.py --dry-run --limit 10
python ingestion/ingest.py
~~~

## systemd

Save the following as /etc/systemd/system/knowledge-mcp.service after adjusting paths and user. The service account needs read access to the checkout and state directory.

~~~ini
[Unit]
Description=Knowledge MCP
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=mcp
WorkingDirectory=/opt/knowledge-mcp/knowledge-mcp
ExecStart=/opt/knowledge-mcp/knowledge-mcp/.venv/bin/python mcp/server.py
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
~~~

~~~bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now knowledge-mcp
sudo journalctl -u knowledge-mcp -f
~~~

After every ingestion run, restart knowledge-mcp to reload the lexical corpus. Check Qdrant's /readyz endpoint and call the MCP knowledge_status tool with a real MCP client; a plain GET is not a tool call. Put an authenticated HTTPS proxy or Cloudflare Access in front of any remote endpoint. See the [Cloudflare guide](../../../docs/cloudflare-access.md).
